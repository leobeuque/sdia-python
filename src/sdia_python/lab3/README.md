# Lab3

## Numpy

Practice your numpy skills in [notebooks/lab3.ipynb](../../notebooks/lab3.ipynb).

## Back to lab2

- Use numpy vectorization power to refactor your code from sdia_python.lab2
- Make sure each method is
  - tested
  - well documented (docstrings + additional comments if needed)
- Generate the documentation

If we have time today or during the next session we'll package + build + publish the project to make it installable using `pip install sdia-python-username`
